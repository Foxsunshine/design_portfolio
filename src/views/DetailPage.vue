        Zoomily is a pet brand for which a visual identity (VI) system has been created. The color
        scheme is inspired by the refined colors prevalent in popular Chinese court dramas from
        2018. The brand primarily targets female customers and incorporates elements from brands
        favored by women. A black cat character has been introduced as well to enhance the brand's
        recognition. The design project also includes some packaging applications.

        Joyoung, as a well-known brand in the small home appliances industry, distributes New Year
        gift packs to employees and major customers to enhance brand recognition. The inspiration
        for this design came from three of Joyoung's main products of 2020 - a water dispenser, a
        rice cooker, and a cooking machine. The visuals prominently feature Joyoung's brand symbol,
        the Joyoung circle, its brand color orange, classic elements like soymilk, along with some
        classic Chinese New Year elements.

        In Tencent's public welfare fundraising campaign, many enterprises have participated in

        participating youth. The overall packaging is made of PVC shell and special public welfare
        paper, and the 100-day plan includes a to-do list and special stickers.

        For the special holiday of Children's Day, Carnival Advertising Company hopes to give each
        of its major clients a gift that brings back childhood innocence. By co-branding with the IP
        image of "little white" from ThinkBig, various gaming elements are used to represent the
        diverse creativity that bursts forth from play among advertisers. The gift is packaged in a
        transparent PVC box containing a skateboard and a roly-poly toy figure of "little white".

        Campus recruitment is a crucial initiative for major companies to recruit new talent.
        Despite being a renowned brand in the small home appliances industry, Joyoung is perceived
        by young people as a traditional, outdated brand known for soymilk machines. The challenge
        of this project is to visually alter the brand image of Joyoung in the minds of young
        people, while keeping the brand's DNA intact, and attract more young people to work at
        Joyoung. The final visual output chose to use large areas of orange, the brand symbol and
        font of Joyoung in a glass texture, and fun typography.

        The greatest challenge for Dragon Boat Festival gift packs in the advertising industry is
        how to make them both creative and practical. Skateboarding is a popular sport among young
        people, and transforming a skateboard into a chair is both decorative and practical. Using
        the concept of "tide player", illustrations combining the Tencent penguin, Dragon Boat
        Festival elements, etc., are applied to the skateboard chair. Additionally, a carpet and
        triangle-shaped dumpling packaging are included, allowing the whole set to be taken out for
        camping or picnicking.
